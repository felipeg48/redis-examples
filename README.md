# Redis Examples
The idea of this repo is to collect several examples of redis development, by using drivers like Jedis and frameworks like Spring.

##redis-demo

This contains several examples, every dependency is based on Spring Boot starters poms, it is recommendable to use a IDE (example STS for easy execution of the individual files):

* *RedisSpringBootApplication.java*. 

If you don't have any IDE then you can run it with:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
