# Redis Examples
The idea of this repo is to collect several examples of redis development, by using drivers like Jedis and frameworks like Spring.

##redis-demo

This contains several examples, every dependency is based on Spring Boot starters poms, it is recommendable to use a IDE (example STS for easy execution of the individual files). It's based on Maven:

* **RedisSpringBootApplication.java**. 

This app shows the simple way to use the spring-data-redis with Spriong Boot. If you don't have any IDE then you can run it with:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
